The given program works on the babynames datasets for different 
countries stored using the following schema :
Country/State, Gender(F or M), Year, Name, Count
The program then finds the count of a name in a particular 
year across all the regions and genders. Stores them in 
descending orer in an ArrayList, and outputs the top k. 
We could use a TreeMap instead of an arraylist to make 
the reduce function more optimal.
